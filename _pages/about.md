I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/). I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering from
[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2016 and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) in 2018.

My current research interests include applied machine learning for design automation and design automation for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits.
